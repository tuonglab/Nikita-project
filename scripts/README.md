# scripts

This directory contains scripts used in the projects that are not necessarily notebooks.

For example, you might have a script that runs a program that you wrote in another language, or a script that downloads data from a database. You call these scripts from the notebooks and this is where you store them.

## File information

It would be good to annotate here what each script means. For example, if you have a script called `download_data.py`, you can write a short description of what it is here.

```
01_scRNAseq_download_record.txt --> this is just a text file with a record of the code run on the hpc in order to download all my scRNA seq datasets 


```
